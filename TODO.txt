A bounty can have:
  - Location
  - Activity (strike/crucible/gambit/patrol (i.e. general or any))
  - Requirement type (patrols/adventures/kills/chests)
  - Kill requirements can have:
    - Ability (super/grenade/melee)
    - Gun type
    - Element type
Steps:
  - Start with either location (crucible/gambit/vex offensive would have no location)
  - Group together by requirement type
    - For kills, group by weapon and element type, not sure yet
    - Need to also account for bounties that require kills with abilities

Interface:
  - Lists steps first on location, then steps to take
  - Displays stats like total xp, infamy/valor/etc., legendary gear after completing all bounties
  - Can select weekly/daily/all bounties/quests
  - Can filter by location/requirements/activity
